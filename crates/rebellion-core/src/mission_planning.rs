//! The AI mission planners' team and decoy selectors
//! (`ghidra/notes/ai-mission-planning.md`).
//!
//! The original keeps one record per character and special force
//! (`FUN_00401d20`, refreshed by `FUN_00402230`): flags at `+0x30`, the
//! missions the object may legally undertake at `+0x34`, and its eight
//! skills at `+0x40`. Each planner class queries those records
//! (`FUN_00403460`), ranks the hits, and takes the best (`FUN_004357b0`)
//! until its team, then its decoy list, is full.
//!
//! port: the original planner runs one state per tick (`FUN_004bced0`) and
//! re-enters its selectors on later cycles. The port plans in one cycle, so
//! the target system (`+0x38`, set in state 6 after the first cycle's
//! selectors) is unset while the selectors run and the nearness query
//! (`FUN_00403750`) never joins.
