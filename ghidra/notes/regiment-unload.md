# Unloading a regiment by hand

Recovered 2026-10-04 from REBEXE.EXE with Homebrew Ghidra 12.1.3 (read-only,
no analysis). Item 2 of the fleet actions plan
(`~/.claude/plans/open-rebellion-2026-10-04-fleet-actions-and-quadrants.md`).
It builds on `move-order.md`, `fleet-window.md` ("Loading a regiment onto a
fleet"), `object-state-flags.md` and `build-delivery.md`.

## The order

A regiment aboard a fleet is listed in the Fleet window's Troops tab. A drag
out of that list ends in `0x29a`, and the galaxy view issues `0x201` Move
(`0x202` with Ctrl) for the whole selection against the drop window's `+0x70`
object (`move-order.md`, "A drag is a move": window type 4). A regiment's
pop-up Move released on a window asks the same `+0x70` (`move-order.md`, "The
release"). The drop targets:

| Window | `+0x70` |
|---|---|
| Sector (type 1) | the system under the point |
| System (type 9) | `FUN_004aa470`: the window's subject |
| System Defenses (type 10) | `FUN_004aa380`: the list item under the point, else the subject |
| Missions (type 11) | `FUN_004a09a0`: the picture gives `+0x1c8`, the list item under the point, else the subject |
| Fleet (type 4) | the fleet or ship under the point (loading, `fleet-window.md`) |

An item that is not a system, fleet or capital ship fails the route with
`1`/`0x25` (`FUN_005531b0`, `move-order.md` "Route refusals").

`FUN_00487cc0` confirms a `0x201` only when the first member's container is a
blockaded system of the member's side. An embarked regiment's container is
its ship, so an unload never asks.

## Refusals

1. **Can move** (`FUN_00578c00`). The regiment's slot `+0x6c` is
   `FUN_00504350`: `FUN_004f9860` (side, untraced, en route and the rest,
   `object-popup-menu.md`), else `1`/`1`. `FUN_005555e0`'s blockade refusal
   (`0x90`/4) covers families `0x20..0x21` only, not regiments.
2. **The group** (`FUN_0053d430`, the `0x204` sub-order's `+0x50`). It
   refuses `1`/`0x28` when the destination's side bits (`+0x24` bits 6..7)
   differ from the order's side, unless every member is a fleet or capital
   ship, or every member is a regiment and the destination is an existing
   (`+0x50` bit `0x40`) system that is not populated (`+0x88 & 1` clear,
   `FUN_0053d430.c:140`). So regiments cannot be put down on an enemy or
   neutral populated planet by hand. Earlier notes read the mask as "bit 1";
   it is bit 0, populated (`economy-systems.md`).
3. **The command** (`FUN_00555920`). The checks run only for a deployed
   object (slot `+0x38` = `0x004f6410`, `+0x50` bit 16,
   `GameObjDeployedNotif`, `build-delivery.md`):
   - `FUN_00555410` → `FUN_00555460` tells whether the object and the
     destination resolve to the same system (`FUN_00555540` on both; it
     starts at 1, so an unresolved side counts as the same);
   - across systems, a zero speed (slot `+0x34(1)`) gives `1`/`0x18`;
   - across systems, with no refusal yet, a regiment (`0x10..0x13`) whose
     destination's side bits differ from its own (`piVar3[9]`, `+0x24`)
     gives `1`/`0x28`;
   - in the same system neither check runs.
4. **The route and legs** (`FUN_0053d430` after the side test:
   `FUN_00551190`, `FUN_005513a0`, then `FUN_00551630` per member). The leg
   builder picks the container each regiment enters and stores it at the
   command's `+0x48`, so step 3's "destination" is that container, not the
   window's target. See "Choosing the container" below.

## Choosing the container

The route context (`FUN_00551100`) holds the side (`+0x14`, `+0x18`) and the
order kind (`+0x1c`; `0x204` for a regiment group). `FUN_005513a0` builds a
room node (`FUN_00552d10` → `FUN_00550700`) for the destination, its
container and every fleet and ship there (`FUN_004ffe70`, `FUN_00502db0`,
mode 4). Each node asks the object, for nine type ranges (`FUN_0054f5b0`:
`0x14`, `0x18`, `0x1c`, `0x20..0x2f`, `0x2c`, `0x30..0x3f`, `0x10..0x13`,
`0x08..0x0f`, `0x40..0x7f`), whether it accepts the kind (slot `+0x74`) and
how much room it has (slot `+0x78`); a node that accepts but reports no room
and no "unlimited" gives `1`/`0x27`.

For a system (vtable `0x0065e640`):

- **Room** (`FUN_00507750`): regiments, fighters, fleets, sectors,
  characters and `0x40..0x7f` are unlimited. Facilities are limited by
  `FUN_00509650`/`FUN_00509660` (`0x90`/1, `0x90`/2).
- **Acceptance** (`FUN_005073d0`) for a `0x204` regiment:
  - a destroyed system (`+0x50` bit 3) gives `1`/`0x22`;
  - `FUN_00553410`: a system not of the order's side gives `1`/`0x24` or
    `1`/`0x28`; not completed (`+0x50` bit 2 clear) `1`/`0x20`; destroyed
    `1`/`0x22`; en route `1`/`0x21`. For a regiment the refusal stands,
    unless the system has `+0x88` bit 1 set, side 3 and is unpopulated;
  - a blockaded system (`+0x88` bit `0x20`) gives `0x90`/4. That is lifted
    for fleets and characters (`0x240`, `0x241`) and kind `0x3f0`, not for a
    regiment.

`FUN_00552300` then places each member:

1. It tries the destination itself (`FUN_00552b10`).
2. For a system it also tries the first fleet of the side
   (`FUN_005097d0`, mode 4) that is not destroyed and has `+0x58` bit 1
   (`FUN_00509b40` and `+0x58` bit 2 for kind `0x270`); untraced: who sets
   those bits.
3. If the best status so far is still a refusal, it tries every fleet of
   the side in the system and each of their ships.
4. The best candidate wins (`FUN_0054fbb0`: no refusal beats a refusal).
   Its status becomes the order's, and the candidate becomes the leg.

For a fleet destination it tries the fleet's ships. For a capital ship
destination it tries that ship. A capital ship (vtable `0x0065d650`)
accepts through slot `+0x74`, `FUN_00500ac0` → `FUN_00553410`: of the side,
completed, not destroyed and not en route (`1`/`0x24`, `0x28`, `0x20`,
`0x22`, `0x21`). Its room, slot `+0x78`, is `FUN_00500b40`
(`fleet-window.md`, "Capacity"). The base slots `+0x70` (`FUN_004f6800`)
and `+0x7c` (`FUN_004f6980`) sit at the same offsets in the regiment,
system and ship vtables, which fixes the system vtable at `0x0065e640`.

So a regiment sent to a planet of its side lands on it. One sent to a
blockaded planet of its side, or to another side's planet, boards a friendly
ship in that system that has room. Without one, the order is refused with
the planet's status (`0x90`/4, `1`/`0x24` or `1`/`0x28`).

## A regiment has speed

A regiment's slot `+0x34` is `FUN_004f63f0`: `DAT_006b9050` while the object
exists (`+0x50` bit 6, `object-state-flags.md`), else 0. `DAT_006b9050` is
GNPRTB 1, which is 100 in every column (`FUN_0053e0b0`, `build-delivery.md`
"Speed (`+0x34`) and mobile"). Special forces and facilities share it. So `1`/`0x18` never
refuses a live regiment. A regiment may therefore move on its own to another
system: onto a planet of its side, or aboard a friendly ship there. `fleet-window.md` and the port carried "a regiment has no speed"
(hyp), and the port refuses a regiment's cross-system move with
`TroopTransportError::RegimentCannotTravel`. That refusal is not the
original's.

## Execute (`FUN_00556390`)

```c
obj = resolve(object);
if (!obj || !obj->deployed())          // slot +0x38
    return obj->move_into(dest, ctx);  // slot +0xa8, no transit
ok = same_system(object, dest, &same); // FUN_00555410
if (ok && !(obj->flags & 0x800))       // not autorouting
    ok = obj->set_in_transit(!same);   // FUN_004f7640, +0x50 bit 5
if (!ok || (obj->flags & 8)) return;   // destroyed
obj->move_into(dest, ctx);             // slot +0xa8
```

Slot `+0xa8` is `FUN_004f8630` → `FUN_0053efa0` (id to object) →
`FUN_004f6fd0`, which reparents the object (`FUN_0053a030`, `FUN_004fc600`),
updates both side views (`FUN_004f9d40`) and calls slot `+0xf4` with the old
and new containers.

So:

- **Within a system** (an unload in orbit) the in-transit bit is written
  clear and the regiment enters the planet's container at once. No time
  passes.
- **Across systems** the in-transit bit is set and the regiment changes
  container at once. Its en route bit (`FUN_004f8240`) then holds until the
  per-object transit (`build-delivery.md`) ends.

## What happens to the rest of the cargo

The order moves only the selected regiments; each is its own command object
(`+0x3c`). Regiments left aboard stay in their ship's container. Nothing in
the original lands cargo without an order: the port's automatic landing
(F-007E, "cargo lands only when its faction is the sole orbital faction") has
no source in this trace.

## Port notes

- `TroopTransportState::disembark_selected` already moves chosen regiments
  from a fleet's cargo to its system's surface. A hand unload is that call
  behind the refusals above, with no transit.
- The hold (`held`, port:) is per fleet. A hand unload removes regiments
  from the cargo, and `forget_if_empty` ends the hold once the fleet carries
  none.
- `RegimentCannotTravel` contradicts the speed above. A regiment's
  cross-system move is a transit (`build-delivery.md`, "Travel": speed 100,
  the arrival tick at `+0x44`), which the port does not have.
- A regiment leaving a blockaded system on its own sets its in-transit bit,
  so the departure roll (`blockade-troop-withdrawal.md`, step 4) applies to
  it as to cargo.

## Still open

- Who sets fleet `+0x58` bits 1 and 2, which steer the leg builder.
- `blockade-troop-withdrawal.md` gives the system vtable as `0x0065e638`
  with `FUN_00508660` at `+0xd0`. From `0x0065e640` that function is
  `+0xc8`, and `FUN_00514a60` calls `+0xc4`, `+0xcc` and `+0xd0`; which
  objects those calls reach is not checked here.
- `FUN_004f9860`'s untraced condition for a regiment.
- The meaning of system `+0x88` bit 1 (set with bit 3 by `FUN_005081f0`,
  system slot `+0xbc`).
- The `0x204`/`0x241` split of a `0x201` group and how `FUN_0053d430`'s
  status reaches the advisor (`mission-dialog.md`, "Refusal").
